            We use a package called semantic-release to manage our release
            process. It's fully automated. Every time we merge into main, it
            triggers the release of a new version.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize="2rem">
            The versioning follows Semantic Versioning, and the type of change
            is triggered by the commit message. Each new version adds info to
            the changelog and publishes info to a Slack channel via a webhook.

          <Text fontSize="2rem">
            This is great for consumers of the library, because they can control
            which features are included in their site. In particular with
            td-crystal, we have a number of different github packages that are
            independent. The codeowners have control over which version they
            include, and when they incorporate new versions.

            number of reasons, including it's pretty aggressive cadence for

            One of the great features of Storybook is its interactive

            and then we can interact with them like a playground to show
            different states of each component, without changing any code. This
            is great for designers and those developers that aren't closely tied
            to and invested in stylekit development. It gives them a quick way
            to gain knowledge about a component without having to dig into the
            code.

            I'm going to walk through the component development process through
            the lens of a recent chart we created for the Predictive Scoring

            So, step one is really...start with the Design. We collaborate with
            the UX team on a project to come up with a game plan. They design
            something amazing, we work with them to decide what is possible, and
            what is practical. Just because something is possible, doesn't
            necessaryily mean it should be implemented, from an engineering
            standpoint. We want to create components that are robust, extensible
            and durable... i.e. not Buggy.
          </Text>
          <Text fontSize="2rem">
            We work with design and iterate, and iterate and iterate until we
            come up with something that we both think is great and doable. Oh,
            and then we iterate some more. An important part of the process is
            really knowing that things will change over time.

            So from this "semi-final" version from design, I like to make a
            checklist of features that I need to implement. So, looking at the
            histogram, I know that in addition to regular chart-type things, I
            need to have some extra dependent axes, I need the bars to be able
            to vary in color, and I need to be able to stack sets of data.

            From that checklist, I like to make some "TODO" tests. This is
            really just a checklist in code form. It gives me a specific set of
            steps to follow to reach my goal. It's a loose interpretation of
            TDD, but it's been super useful for me as an engineer. It helps keep
            me focused, and from going down rabbit holes.

            So, not only do we need to create a chart, right? We need to create
            a chart that has an API that is pretty easy to use. I love looking
            at other component libraries for inspiration. This inspiration is
            two-fold. One, if I'm trying to implement a piece of functionality
            in one of my components, it's nice to see how a different library
            accomplished the same thing. Second, and most importantly, what does
            that component's API look like? How do they go from a component that
            works, to a component that others will gladly use. There are lots of
            really smart engineers that have probably already solved the same
            problem I'm trying to solve, so I'm going to lean on their
            expertise. Back when I was a singer, and playing Eliza Doolittle in
            My Fair Lady, I watched Audrey Hepburn, because you know what? She
            really knew what she was doing.

            Next step is to make that component flexible. If there is anything
            that developing in general that I've learned, it's that we're always
            going to be changing and refactoring. The same goes for component
            libraries. There will always be new use cases that arise, and it's
            good to think of the future when developing. (Storybook really helps
            with this). So, for example, we didnt' just create a histogram that
            rendered specifically 2 sets of data in multi-colors. It can render
            one set of data. It can change colors, it can include the dependent
            axes or not. It has a sorting function if the developer needs to
            change the order of their data sets. Does it need to be combined
            with a slider? No way.

            in general. William Gonzalez on my team has really helped us

            Like I mentioned previously, React-docgen publishes prop tables for
            each component, what the type is, and we can interact with those
            tables thanks to Storybook. React-docgen will also parse out our
            comments for each prop type, so that we can give even more
            information to developers.

            Just kidding. In addition to building and documenting those
            components, we have to communicate about them. If you build it,
            honestly, the developers aren't just going to fawn over you
            incessantly. You need to teach them how to use it.

            We've recently started a weekly series of "Stylekit tips" videos
            that we share with development and design folks. It's a fun way to
            communicate what we're doing, and gives devs bite-sized info that
            they can refer back to later. I'll introduce a component and its
            features, do a refactor using a new component, or just talk about
            features about particular components that maybe devs don't know
            about, but could really help them in their work. We collect all of
            these videos on a page in Confluence, and there's a place where
            developers can make suggestions for future videos that they'd like
            to see.

            As a frontend team, we've been very busy over the past year building
            out td-crystal. At the same time, we've been pushing ourselves to
            get much better at writing documentation. One of the most gratifying
            things that happened to me recently, was linking out to some
            documentation that I wrote to one of my colleagues, that I thought
            probably no one but me or my team might ever need, but they did, and
            now we have this process well-documented, so people without the full
            context can accomplish the task.
